# History of Handwashing
Analysis of Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing. 

Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician born in 1818 and was active at the Vienna General Hospital. Dr. Semmelweis was troubled becauseof childbed fever: A deadly disease affecting women that just have given birth. It was in early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital as many as 10% of the women giving birth die from it. He found the cause of childbed fever was the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies. And they won't listen to him and wash their hands!

In this notebook, we're going to reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of handwashing. Let's start by looking at the data that made Semmelweis realize that something was wrong with the procedures at Vienna General Hospital.
